        "accidental - A non-hostile actor whose benevolent or harmless intent inadvertently causes harm. For example, a well-meaning and dedicated employee who through distraction or poor training unintentionally causes harm to his or her organization.",
        "coercion - Being forced to act on someone else's behalf. Adversaries who are motivated by coercion are often forced through intimidation or blackmail to act illegally for someone else’s benefit. Unlike the other motivations, a coerced person does not act for personal gain, but out of fear of incurring a loss.",
        "dominance - A desire to assert superiority over someone or something else. Adversaries who are seeking dominance over a target are focused on using their power to force their target into submission or irrelevance. Dominance may be found with ideology in some state-sponsored attacks and with notoriety in some cyber vandalism-based attacks.",
        "ideology - A passion to express a set of ideas, beliefs, and values that may shape and drive harmful and illegal acts. Adversaries who act for ideological reasons (e.g., political, religious, human rights, environmental, desire to cause chaos/anarchy, etc.) are not usually motivated primarily by the desire for profit; they are acting on their own sense of morality, justice, or political loyalty. For example, an activist group may sabotage a company’s equipment because they believe the company is harming the environment.",
        "notoriety - Seeking prestige or to become well known through some activity. Adversaries motivated by notoriety are often seeking either personal validation or respect within a community and staying covert is not a priority. In fact, one of the main goals is to garner the respect of their target audience.",
        "organizational-gain - Seeking advantage over a competing organization, including a military organization. Adversaries motivated by increased profit or other gains through an unfairly obtained competitive advantage are often seeking theft of intellectual property, business processes, or supply chain agreements and thus accelerating their position in a market or capability.",
        "personal-gain - The desire to improve one’s own financial status. Adversaries motivated by a selfish desire for personal gain are often out for gains that come from financial fraud, hacking for hire, or intellectual property theft. While a Threat Actor or Intrusion Set may be seeking personal gain, this does not mean they are acting alone. Individuals can band together solely to maximize their own personal profits.",
        "personal-satisfaction - A desire to satisfy a strictly personal goal, including curiosity, thrill-seeking, amusement, etc. Threat Actors or Intrusion Set driven by personal satisfaction may incidentally receive some other gain from their actions, such as a profit, but their primary motivation is to gratify a personal, emotional need. Individuals can band together with others toward a mutual, but not necessarily organizational, objective.",
        "revenge - A desire to avenge perceived wrongs through harmful actions such as sabotage, violence, theft, fraud, or embarrassing certain individuals or the organization. A disgruntled Threat Actor or Intrusion Set seeking revenge can include current or former employees, who may have extensive knowledge to leverage when conducting attacks. Individuals can band together with others if the individual believes that doing so will enable them to cause more harm.",
        "unpredictable - Acting without identifiable reason or purpose and creating unpredictable events. Unpredictable is not a miscellaneous or default category. Unpredictable means a truly random and likely bizarre event, which seems to have no logical purpose to the victims."

  "description": "A object template describing an Intrusion Set as defined in STIX 2.1. An Intrusion Set is a grouped set of adversarial behaviors and resources with common properties that is believed to be orchestrated by a single organization. An Intrusion Set may capture multiple Campaigns or other activities that are all tied together by shared attributes indicating a commonly known or unknown Threat Actor. New activity can be attributed to an Intrusion Set even if the Threat Actors behind the attack are not known. Threat Actors can move from supporting one Intrusion Set to supporting another, or they may support multiple Intrusion Sets.  Where a Campaign is a set of attacks over a period of time against a specific set of targets to achieve some objective, an Intrusion Set is the entire attack package and may be used over a very long period of time in multiple Campaigns to achieve potentially multiple purposes.  While sometimes an Intrusion Set is not active, or changes focus, it is usually difficult to know if it has truly disappeared or ended. Analysts may have varying level of fidelity on attributing an Intrusion Set back to Threat Actors and may be able to only attribute it back to a nation state or perhaps back to an organization within that nation state.",
